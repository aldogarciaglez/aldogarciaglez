<br /><br />
I am Aldo Garcia, a Power Platform and Azure engineer, eager to learn and be a creative coder and self-proclaimed developer specialized in Power Platform, Dynamics 365 CE and .NET.<br /><br />
I am an avid learner for learning and growing not only in the Power Platform and Azure Stack, but also for the front-end and back-end development with the CI/CD automation.<br /><br />
My goals are to contribute what I learn during my experiences in my professional career, adding personal projects that will help me to learn, practice and grow in the knowledge and skills for technologies and tools that are current in the market.<br /><br />
I am always looking to work with people that are idealists like me, as well as who are interested in creating in working on cool, interesting and meaningful projects! Shoot me [an email](mailto:aldoantoniogarciagonzalez@hotmail.com) if that sounds interesting for you!
